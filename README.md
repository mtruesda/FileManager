# File Manager Using Splay Trees and Python

## Description

### Main.py

Creates a GUI for the user that allows them to work with their files. The GUI will aim to look most like a windows file manager.

### tree.py

Uses a splay tree to handle the file manager. This will allow me to put together a recents selection and a bunch of other folders relating to different traversal methods.
